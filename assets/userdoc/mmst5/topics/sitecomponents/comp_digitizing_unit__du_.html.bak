    <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The <em class="ph i">Radar Digitizing Unit (RDU)</em> creates the radar tracks according to the
        received data.</p>

        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">RDU</em> is a device where the maritime radar is connected. The <em class="ph i">RDU</em> is
            located at the <em class="ph i">Upmast Cabinet</em> and its function is to create the radar tracks
            according to the received radar data.</p>

        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">RDU</em> takes the digital formatted radar information input and provides clutter
            filtering, noise reduction processing, raw video processing and formatting, bandwidth
            managing, network distribution and radar monitoring. Furthermore each <em class="ph i">RDU Plot
                Extraction</em> processes one of the connected <em class="ph i">Maritime Radars Raw Data</em>. The
            MS component aims to extract plots from the raw data, then to detect and track
            targets.</p>

        <p class="p">The radar data information acquired by the <em class="ph i">RDU</em> is transferred for presentation to
            the operators at the C2 room in its most native form, in order to retain the quality of
            its content. It is also processed for detection/tracking and is archived for later
            replay.</p>
